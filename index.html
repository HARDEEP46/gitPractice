<p>
    here i am trying to add a github repo through terminal to direct github , 
    how could i do it ? 
    firstly initialize the git... 
    // git init 
    then , add the files to staging area 
    //git add index.html
    just to ensure , that everything is good till now , 
    //git status 
    and then we have to commit the changes , 
    //git commit -m "initial changes made"
    after that rename the branch if there you face any main branch error ,
    //git branch -M main 
    then add the link to the repo 
    //git remote add origin <link>
    then push , 
    //git push origin main
</p>

<p>
    okay so this will be the third change to be made , 
    upto the moment what i have learnt about the git is , it is nice , and amazing 
    it might be because i am using it for the first time , doesn't matter though , 
    the steps to do this all stuff is easy and nice ,
    1. initialize the git // git init 
    2. after creating some files , commit changes // git commit -m "first commit"
    - and sometimes it may show error for the main branch , 
    so just change the branch to main using git command , 
    // git branch -M main
    3. then add the github repo to git , // git remote add origin <link>
    4. then add the files // git add index.html 
    5. then push the file , // git push origin main
