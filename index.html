<p>
    here i am trying to add a github repo through terminal to direct github , 
    how could i do it ? 
    firstly initialize the git... 
    // git init 
    then , add the files to staging area 
    //git add index.html
    just to ensure , that everything is good till now , 
    //git status 
    and then we have to commit the changes , 
    //git commit -m "initial changes made"
    after that rename the branch if there you face any main branch error ,
    //git branch -M main 
    then add the link to the repo 
    //git remote add origin <link>
    then push , 
    //git push origin main
</p>
